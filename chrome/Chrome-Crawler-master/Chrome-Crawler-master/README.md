## Description

The idea is simple really. You just give it a URL, it then goes off and finds all the links on that page then follows them to more pages then gets all the links and follows them and so on and so on.

Along the way it checks each page to see if there are any ‘interesting’ files linked there, if it finds an interesting link it will flag it for you so you can check it out.

Theres an options page that lets you customise the way it all works:
